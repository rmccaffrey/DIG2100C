        <h1>Learning Module 1 Assignment</h1>
        
        <h2>What is your name?</h2>
        <p>My name is Robert McCaffrey.</p>
        <h2>What do you hope to learn in this course?</h2>
        <p>I hope to learn enough about hard-code HTML and CSS to evaluate 
        student work for students wanting to skip DIG 2100 and take the advanced 
        web essentials course.</p>
        <h2>What was the most important thing you learned in chapter 1?</h2>
        <p>Although I knew about CSS conceptutally, I'd never tried to create 
            a CSS document. The most important part of the first chapter for me 
            was learning some of the CSS syntax and what it does.
        </p>
        <h2>Are you a Macintosh or PC user?</h2>
        <p>I'm mostly on a Mac.</p>
        <h2>What text editor are you using?</h2>
        <p>I'm doing my work in the Cloud 9 IDE and moving it to TextEdit for 
            the zipping and delivery.
