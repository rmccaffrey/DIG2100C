        <h1>Places I want to visit</h1>
        
        <h2>Glacier National Park</h2>
        
        <p>I spent some of my formative years growing up in Wyoming and Montana,
        which gave me a chance to visit several state and national parks. I've 
        seen Yellowstone, Red Lodge, Devil's Tower, the Little Bighorn Battlefield,
         and Mount Rushmore.</p>
          
         <p>One place I never made it is Glacier National Park, located 
         in north-west Montana. I've wanted for a long time to visit its mountains 
             and see its population of <a href="moose.html">large wildlife</a>: 
             moose, elk and grizzly bear. As the park website puts it:
         </p>
         
        <blockquote>Come and experience Glacier's pristine forests, alpine 
        meadows, rugged mountains, and spectacular lakes. With over 700 miles of
        trails, Glacier is a hiker's paradise for adventurous visitors seeking
        wilderness and solitude.</blockquote>
        
        <p>I would love to go and do nothing for two weeks but eat well, sleep 
            early, and <a href="panorama.html">walk in the mountains</a> all day 
            long.</p>
        
          <h2>What I plan to bring</h2>
          
        <p>Since this would be a hiking trip in the vicinity of bears, and since 
        I'm going to want to remember my stay at Glacier for the rest of my life,
        here is what I plan to bring for the trip.
        </p>
